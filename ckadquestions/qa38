a. Create a Multi-Container POD with the name of multi-container.
b. There should be three containers in the pod.
c. Name the first container should be first-container, 2nd container should be second-container and 3rd container should be third-container
d. 1st container should be launched from nginx image, the second container should be launched from 
e. Connect to the first-container and run the following command:  apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools
f. Connect to the third-container and identify the ports in which processes are listening. Perform wget command on those ports and check if you can download the HTML page.

Solution:

Step 1: Create Multi-Container Pods based on defined specification

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multicontainer
spec:
  containers:
  - name: first-container
    image: nginx
  - name: second-container
    image: nginx
  - name: third-container
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]

Step 2: Connect to First Container and Run Defined Commands

kubectl exec -it multicontainer -c first-container bash

apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools

Step 3: Connect to 3rd container and Identify Ports

kubectl exec -it multicontainer -c third-container sh

Step 4: Perform wget on all the ports

wget localhost:80
wget localhost:9080
