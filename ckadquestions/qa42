Create a deployment named qa42-updates. The deployment should be launched from nginx image. There should be two  replicas. Verify the status of the deployment. As part of rolling update, update the image to nginx2:alpine. Verify the status of deployment. Perform a rollback to the previous version. Verify the status of deployment.

solution:

Step 1: Create a Deployment

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: qa42-updates
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: qa42-updates


Step 2: Perform Rolling Update
kubectl set image deployment qa42-updates qa42-updates=nginx2:alpine --record=true

Step 3: Verify Status of Deployment
This can be verified in multiple ways, here are some of the approaches

kubectl rollout status deployment qa42-updates
kubectl get pods

In the output of kubectl get pods command, you will see that new POD as part of deployment has failed to launch with the rror of ImagePullBackOff
