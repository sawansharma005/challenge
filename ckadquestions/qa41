#Troubleshooting
Apply the Following Manifest File to your k8s:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: newqa41

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    run: troubleshoot-deployment
  name: troubleshoot-deployment
  namespace: newqa41
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: troubleshoot-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: troubleshoot-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ninx
        name: troubleshoot-deployment

There are failed deployments within your cluster. Find and fix it.

Solution:

Apply the Provided manifest file

kubectl apply -f troubleshoot-deployment.yaml

Step 2: Find all the deployments across all the namespaces

kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces

In the output of above command, you will see one deployment where none of the pods are in ready state (0/2). The deployment name is troubleshoot-deployment and resides in newqa41 namespace.

When you inspect the properties of deployment, you will see there is typo in the name of nginx image, it is "ninx". Edit the deployment and add the right name.

kubectl edit deployment troubleshoot-deployment  -n newqa41

After you have modified and added the right image, re-run the kubectl get deployment command for all namespaces to ensure that all the pods are up (2/2)
