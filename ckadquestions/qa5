# Create a nginx pod named as hello-world with version 1.17.4 and expose it to port 8080.
#Then change the Image version to 1.15-alpine for the pod you just created and verify the image version is updated


Solution
kubectl run hello-world --image=nginx:1.17.4 --restart=Never --port=8080

kubectl set image pod/hello-world hello-world=nginx:1.15-alpine

kubectl describe po hello-world
