#Create a job named as k8sjob with the image busybox which echos “K8s Job” under ns 15 namespace
#Verify the job and the associated pod is created and check the logs as well
#Delete the job we just created
#Create the same job and make it run 10 times one after one

Solution:

#create Job
kubectl create job k8sjob --image=busybox -n ns15 --dry-run -o yaml -- echo "K8s Job" > k8sjob.yaml 
kubectl create -f k8sjob.yaml

#Verify the job and associated pod
kubectl -n ns15 get job
kubectl -n ns15 get po
kubectl -n ns15 logs k8s*

#Delete the above job
kubectl delete job k8sjob

#Recreate the job with 10 run
