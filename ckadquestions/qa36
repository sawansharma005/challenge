#Docker and Configuration

Create a new container named demo-container from nginx image. Login to the Docker container and create a new file named modified.txt in the /tmp location.

Save this container image to a TAR file so that it can be exported to a different server.   

Solution:

# Run Docker container
docker container run -d --name demo-container nginx

# Login into docker container
docker exec -it demo-container sh

# Create modified.txt under /tmp directory in docker container
 touch /tmp/modified.txt

# Save container to an image
docker commit "$CONTAINER ID"

# Validate docker image and tag it to readable name
docker images
docker tag $REPOSITORY demo-container:latest

# Save the image to the tar file
docker save demo-container > demo-container.tar
