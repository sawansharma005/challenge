#Troubelshooting
A replicaset rs-d33393 is created. However the pods are not coming up. Identify and fix the issue.

Once fixed, ensure the ReplicaSet has 4 Ready replicas.

#replicaset monifest
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: rs-d33393
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: busybox-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        name: busybox-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
        image: busyboxXXXXXXX
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: busybox-container
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        terminationMessagePolicy: File
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      securityContext: {}
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30

solution:

kubectl get all 

The status of pods shows invalid image name so we need to describe the replicaset and see the image

As you can see the image is pointing to busyboxXXXXXXX which is a typo. To get the issue solved do

kubectl edit rs rs-d33393

replace the image with busybox.
