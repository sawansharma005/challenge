Create a deployment named qa44-configuration. The deployment should have 3 replicas of nginx image. Once the deployment is created, verify the maxSurge and maxUnavailable parameters. Edit the the maxUnavailable to 0 and maxSurge to 30% on the live deployment object. Once those two parameters are modified, change the image of the deployment to nginx:alpine. Make sure to use the record instruction on rolling updates.

Solution:

Step 1: Create the Deployment.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    run: qa44-configuration
  name: qa44-configuration
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: qa44-configuration
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: qa44-configuration
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: qa44-configuration

Step 2: Verification
To verify the maxSurge and maxUnavailable parameters, run the following command:
kubectl get deployment qa44-configuration -o yaml

Step 3: Modify the Parameters
kubectl edit deployment qa44-configuration
Edit the maxUnavailable to 0 and maxSurge to 30%

Set 4: Set New Image;

kubectl set image deployment qa44-configuration qa44-configuration=nginx:alpine --record
